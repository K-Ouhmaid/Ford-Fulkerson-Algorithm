# Ford-Fulkerson-Algorithm
Given a graph which represents a flow network where every edge has a capacity. Also given two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in the graph, find the maximum possible flow from s to t with following constraints:  a) Flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge.  b) Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and
